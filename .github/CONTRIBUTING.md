### **Example Function Documentation**

```python
def train_neural_chess_engine_parallel(
    num_games: int = 100,
    epochs_per_game: int = 3,
    learning_rate: float = 0.001,
    model_name: str = "chess_neural_model",
    num_parallel_games: int = 3,
    existing_model_path: Optional[str] = None
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Train the neural chess engine through parallel self-play.

    This function orchestrates parallel training of the neural chess engine
    by running multiple games simultaneously and training the model on the
    collected data.

    Args:
        num_games: Total number of games to play for training
        epochs_per_game: Number of training epochs per game
        learning_rate: Learning rate for the neural network optimizer
        model_name: Base name for saving trained models
        num_parallel_games: Number of games to run in parallel
        existing_model_path: Path to existing model for incremental training

    Returns:
        List of dictionaries containing training results for each game

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If training fails due to insufficient resources
        ValueError: If training parameters are invalid

    Example:
        >>> results = train_neural_chess_engine_parallel(
        ...     num_games=30,
        ...     epochs_per_game=5,
        ...     learning_rate=0.001,
        ...     num_parallel_games=3
        ... )
        >>> print(f"Training completed with {len(results)} games")
        Training completed with 30 games
    """

        tensor = engine.board_to_tensor(engine.board)
        assert tensor.shape == (1, 12, 8, 8)  # Expected shape
        assert tensor.dtype == torch.float32

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("depth,expected_moves", [
        (1, 20),  # Starting position has 20 legal moves
        (2, 400), # Depth 2 has ~400 positions
    ])
    def test_search_depth(self, engine, depth, expected_moves):
        """Test search at different depths."""
        best_move = engine.get_best_move(depth, 2.0)
